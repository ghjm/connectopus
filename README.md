### How to run it

(Note: these instructions assume you are on Linux.  Most, but not all, of this will also work on Windows and Mac.)

* Have an SSH key loaded into an agent (OpenSSH or compatible on Linux/Mac, or Pageant on Windows).  Your SSH key is used to sign configuration bundles to prove their authenticity.

* Review the included [`test.yml`](./test.yml) configuration file.  This configures a three-node network that demonstrates some of the features of Connectopus.

* Launch the first node, `bar`, which is the central listener:
  ```
  ./connectopus init --id bar --config test.yml --run
  ```
  This reads test.yml, signs it, and launches a new node named bar with the given configuration.  If you shut down the node, you can restart it without re-initializing using:
  ```
  ./connectopus node --id bar
  ```

* Launch the other two nodes:
  ```
  ./connectopus init --id foo --subnet fd00::/8 --ip fd00::1:1 --backend 'type=dtls-dialer,peer=localhost:4444,psk=test-psk' --run
  ./connectopus init --id baz --subnet fd00::/8 --ip fd00::3:1 --backend 'type=dtls-dialer,peer=localhost:4444,psk=test-psk' --run
  ```
  Note that we are giving these nodes just enough configuration to reach `bar`, which they will then pull their configuration from.  (We could have just done `--config test.yml` for all three nodes and it would have worked, but this is more fun.)

* At this point, you are probably seeing error messages on `foo` about being unable to configure the ctun tunnel interface.  To fix this, do:
  ```
  sudo ./connectopus setup-tunnel --config test.yml --id foo
  ```
  This will create a tun/tap interface named ctun and configure it as needed.  Once this is done, within a few seconds the `foo` node should launch the tunnel successfully.

* Check out the UI
  ```
  ./connectopus ui --node foo
  ```

* From the shell, try using the tunnel interface to talk to nodes inside the Connectopus mesh:
  ```
  ping fd00::1:1
  traceroute fd00::3:1
  nc fd00::3:1 7
  ```

* Enter a Connectopus network namespace (Linux only):
  ```
  ./connectopus nsenter --node foo
  ```
  then, from inside the subshell, just use normal Linux commands:
  ```
  ifconfig
  traceroute fd00::3:1
  ```
  Note that you can refer to nodes by name using the built-in DNS server:
  ```
  ping bar
  traceroute baz
  ```

* Edit the running configuration:
  ```
  ./connectopus config edit --node foo
  ```
  This downloads the running configuration from foo and opens it.  After you make changes and save, the new configuration is signed and uploaded back to `foo`, and then shared with the rest of the network.  You can add and remove services, namespaces, etc, and they will be restarted and reconfigured on the relevant nodes.  For example, you can copy the service configuration from `baz` to `bar`, after which you can `nc fd00::2:1 7`.  Even though you're talking to `foo`, `bar`'s configuration will be updated.


### How to build from source

* Install needed distro packages
    * Fedora:
      ```
      sudo dnf -y install curl make findutils direnv util-linux-core nodejs gcc
      ```
    * Ubuntu:
      ```
      sudo apt install -y curl make gcc direnv sudo
      curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
      sudo apt install -y nodejs
      ```

* Install Go 1.18 or better

  Use `go version` to check your Go version.  If your distro doesn't include at least 1.18, you can install it locally using:
  ```
  mkdir $HOME/go-1.18.3 && \
    curl -L https://go.dev/dl/go1.18.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz | \
    tar xfvz - --strip-components=1 -C $HOME/go-1.18.3
  ```

* (Optional) Add direnv hook to the shell and authorize the directory.    
  ```
  echo 'eval "$(direnv hook bash)"' >> $HOME/.bashrc
  . $HOME/.bashrc
  direnv allow
  ```
  For shells other than bash, consult https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html.
   
  You can create an `.envrc.local` file with your own settings.  One use of this is if your distro has an older Go version, to make sure that Go 1.18 is added to your path whenever you cd into this directory, like this:
  ```
  echo PATH_add $HOME/go-1.18.3/bin > .envrc.local
  ```

* Build the software
  ```
  make all
  ```
